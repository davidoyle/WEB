Dear Minister [Last Name],
My name is [Your Full Name], a [your age]-year-old [your job title] living in [your city /
community]. I am writing regarding the handling of my WorkSafeBC claim ([Claim Number]) and
to respectfully request your office’s oversight.
[IF you have already contacted your MLA – keep this paragraph]
[MLA [MLA Name], MLA for [Riding], has been assisting me since [month/year] and their office
has already contacted WorkSafeBC on my behalf. Despite this, key issues remain unresolved
and I appear to have reached an impasse within the existing process.]
[IF you have NOT contacted your MLA – you can use this paragraph instead, or delete it
entirely]
[I understand that MLAs and the Minister cannot personally adjudicate individual claims, but I
am concerned that the way my claim is being handled may indicate a breakdown in the normal
oversight and accountability processes.]
I have attached a short briefing note that summarizes:
- The timeline of my injury and claim
- The decisions made so far
- New medical or factual evidence that has not been fully addressed
- Specific questions that remain unanswered by WorkSafeBC
In particular, my main concerns are:
- [Example: Termination of wage-loss benefits despite ongoing medical restrictions]
- [Example: Medical evidence from my treating providers has not been addressed in decisions]
- [Example: Delays or refusals to approve reasonable diagnostic tests (such as an MRI)]
- [Example: Lack of clear written reasons answering key questions I have raised]
I am not asking you to decide my claim. Rather, I am asking for your help to ensure that:
- New and relevant evidence is properly considered
- My questions receive clear, written answers
- The processes set out in the Workers Compensation Act and WorkSafeBC policy are properly
followed in my case
If it would assist your office, I can provide copies of:
- Key medical reports (for example, specialist reports, GP forms, diagnostic requisitions)
- Correspondence with WorkSafeBC and/or the Review Division
- Any prior decisions or reasons I have received
I would also appreciate the opportunity to brief a member of your staff by phone or video
conference at your convenience.
My specific requests are:
1. [Example: A written confirmation from WorkSafeBC of the current status of my claim and any
planned reassessment or review.]
2. [Example: A written response to the unanswered questions listed in my briefing note,
including how new medical evidence has been considered.]
3. [Optional: Example: If appropriate, a management-level review to determine whether the
handling of my claim has been consistent with legislation, policy, and basic fairness.]
I know your time is extremely limited, and I am grateful for any attention you or your staff are
able to give this. If you would like any additional information or documentation, I can provide it
within [24–48] hours.
Thank you for your time and for your service to injured workers in British Columbia.
Sincerely,

To your MLA:
Subject: WorkSafeBC claim [Claim Number] – request for assistance and oversight
Dear [MLA Name],
My name is [Your Full Name]. I live in [your neighbourhood / city] in the riding of [Riding Name].
I am writing to ask for your help and oversight regarding the handling of my WorkSafeBC claim
([Claim Number]).
On [date of injury], I was injured while working as a [job title, e.g., “warehouse worker,” “care
aide,” “concrete cutter”]. Since then, I have been dealing with WorkSafeBC about [very short
summary: e.g., wage-loss benefits, medical treatment, return to work].
At this point, I am struggling with the following issues:
- [Example: My wage-loss benefits were stopped even though my doctor still has me on
restrictions.]
- [Example: Medical reports from my doctor/physiotherapist do not appear to have been
properly considered or explained in the decision.]
- [Example: My employer has not cooperated with return-to-work or modified duties, and I am
not sure what is being done about it.]
- [Example: I have asked clear questions in writing but received no real answers, only repeated
form letters.]
I understand that you cannot personally decide my claim, and I am not asking you to override
WorkSafeBC. I am asking for your help to:
- Make sure my concerns and evidence are being taken seriously, and
- Ensure that WorkSafeBC is following its own rules and obligations in my case.
If your office is able to assist, I would be grateful if you could:
1. Review a short summary of my situation and the key decisions so far; and
2. Ask WorkSafeBC, through the appropriate channels, to provide clear, written answers to the
main questions I have raised.
I can provide:
- Copies of recent decision letters from WorkSafeBC
- Key medical reports (for example, my doctor’s current restrictions)
- A short timeline of what has happened so far
If someone from your office could speak with me by phone or email, I would appreciate the
chance to explain my situation in a bit more detail.
Thank you for taking the time to read this and for the work you do on behalf of people in our
community.
Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]

Email to the Entire Legislature
Subject: Formal report to all Members – systemic concerns regarding [Agency Name]
Dear Honourable Members,
I am writing to you as a citizen providing a formal report on what I believe to be an operational
failure of [Agency Name]. My case (File/Claim #[File or Claim Number]) is offered as a case
study in how legislation, policy, and principles of administrative justice can be undermined in
practice.
The attached file contains [brief description: e.g., “a complete email thread between myself, my
elected representative’s office, and [Agency Name]” / “a summary of decisions and
correspondence to date”]. It serves as real-time, documented evidence of the systemic issues
outlined below.
1. [Heading for Issue Area #1 – e.g., “Evidence Handling and Decision-Making”]
• [Bullet 1 – short, factual description of what happened in this theme]
• [Bullet 2 – another key fact or pattern]
• [Bullet 3 – how this behaviour conflicts with law/policy/fairness, in your view]
2. [Heading for Issue Area #2 – e.g., “Procedural Fairness and Process”]
• [Bullet 1 – arbitrary/contradictory decisions, lack of investigation, etc.]
• [Bullet 2 – failures to follow their own procedures or timelines]
• [Bullet 3 – examples of non-answers or ignored questions]
3. [Heading for Issue Area #3 – e.g., “Oversight and Transparency”]
• [Bullet 1 – inaccurate or incomplete information given to an elected office, if applicable]
• [Bullet 2 – how advocacy through an MLA/MP/etc. was neutralized or redirected into a “void”]
• [Bullet 3 – problems with access to records, FOI, internal notes, or audit logs, if relevant]
The Implications for All [Residents/Workers/Constituents] & for This Legislature
If [Agency Name] can:
• [Short line summarizing Issue Area #1 – e.g., “Disregard or minimize treating/primary
evidence”],
• [Short line summarizing Issue Area #2 – e.g., “Make contradictory decisions without
investigation or explanation”],
• [Short line summarizing Issue Area #3 – e.g., “Provide inaccurate or non-responsive
information to elected offices”],
• [Optional extra line – e.g., “Restrict oversight using internal ‘scope’ rules that it controls
itself”],
then no [worker/constituent] is secure, and the mechanisms of democratic accountability are
weakened.
This is not a dispute over [single outcome or diagnosis].
It is a demonstration that the system’s checks and balances are failing in practice.
The attached material is not just my story; it is a preview of what any Member may encounter
when attempting to oversee this agency on behalf of their constituents.
I am available to provide any further documentation that may assist. My complete file is
available to any Member who wishes to verify this report.
Respectfully,

Email to the Speaker
Subject: For the Speaker’s attention – concerns regarding oversight and [Agency Name]
Dear Honourable Speaker [Last Name],
I am writing to you in your capacity as Speaker of the [Name of Legislature], to report issues I
have encountered in how [Agency Name] interacts with Members’ offices and, by extension,
with the Legislature’s oversight function.
My case (File/Claim #[File or Claim Number]) is offered as a case study in systemic patterns,
not as a request for adjudication of my individual matter.
1. [Heading #1 – e.g., “Information Provided to Members”]
• [Brief factual example of incomplete or incorrect information given to an MLA/MP office]
• [Explanation that the Member relied on this information to decide how to proceed]
• [Short line on how this undermines their ability to scrutinize the agency]
2. [Heading #2 – e.g., “Neutralization of Oversight Efforts”]
• [Example of specific, substantive questions raised through a Member’s office]
• [Description of generic, non-responsive, or “out of scope” replies from the agency]
• [Short line on how this channels oversight into narrow, agency-controlled pathways]
3. [Heading #3 – e.g., “Implications for the Legislature”]
• [Short statement about how these practices affect all Members’ ability to assist constituents]
• [Short statement about risk to the Legislature’s scrutiny and accountability role]
• [Optional: link to any particular committee/mandate if you know it, or leave general]
Taken together, these patterns suggest that [Agency Name] can, in practice:
• Provide incomplete or inaccurate information to Members’ offices;
• Limit or avoid meaningful responses to oversight questions; and
• Shape the scope of Member involvement through internal rules that it controls.
This raises concerns not only for my own situation, but for the institution’s ability to hold public
bodies to account.
I respectfully request that your office:
• Consider whether the issues described here may warrant attention through any appropriate
parliamentary mechanism (such as referral to a committee or other process you deem suitable);
and
• Consider ways to ensure that Members are able to obtain accurate, complete information
from [Agency Name] when carrying out their representative and oversight duties.
I have attached a short summary and relevant correspondence between myself, my
representative’s office, and [Agency Name]. I am willing to provide my complete file and any
additional documentation that may assist.
Thank you for your consideration and for your role in safeguarding the integrity of the
Legislature.
Respectfully,
[Your Full Name]

Email to the Premier:
Subject: Request for attention – systemic concerns regarding [Agency Name] and oversight
Dear Premier [Last Name],
My name is [Your Full Name], and I live in [City / Community]. I am writing to bring to your
attention systemic concerns about how [Agency Name] is operating and how it responds to
oversight from elected representatives.
I am not asking you to decide my individual file. I am asking you, as head of government, to
ensure that public bodies under your government’s responsibility are acting lawfully, fairly, and
in line with your stated commitments to [e.g., fairness, accountability, worker protection, etc.].
Using my case (File/Claim #[File or Claim Number]) as an example, I have observed three main
areas of concern:
1. [Heading #1 – e.g., “Evidence and Decision-Making”]
• [Brief description of how decisions appear inconsistent with treating/primary evidence]
• [Example of internal opinions being preferred without clear reasoning]
• [Note that requests for explanation produced generic or incomplete responses]
2. [Heading #2 – e.g., “Procedural Fairness and Duties”]
• [Example of contradictory decisions, unclear processes, missed timelines, etc.]
• [Description of how duties owed by other parties (e.g., employers, service providers) do not
seem to be enforced]
• [Short line on limited opportunity to respond to new information or errors]
3. [Heading #3 – e.g., “Oversight and Communication with Elected Offices”]
• [Example of incomplete or inaccurate information being given to a representative’s office]
• [Example of substantive questions being labelled “out of scope” or answered in a non-
responsive way]
• [Short line about how this neutralizes the representative’s ability to assist and to scrutinize]
If [Agency Name] can:
• Minimize or ignore treating/primary evidence,
• Make contradictory or poorly explained decisions,
• Fail to enforce duties owed under its governing framework, and
• Provide non-responsive or inaccurate information to Members’ offices without effective
correction,
then both individual citizens and the broader system of democratic accountability are at risk.
My requests to your office are:
1. That you ensure the responsible Minister and ministry are made aware of these documented
concerns and review them;
2. That you seek assurances that [Agency Name] will:
• Improve how it handles evidence, explains decisions, and enforces duties; and
• Review how it communicates with Members’ offices and responds to oversight questions;
and
3. That you consider whether any broader review, directive, or other response is needed to
align [Agency Name]’s practices with your government’s commitments.
I have attached a short summary and key correspondence (including communications with my
representative’s office and [Agency Name]). I am prepared to provide my complete file and any
further documentation your staff may require.
Thank you for your time and for your service to [Jurisdiction].
Respectfully,
[Your Full Name]
